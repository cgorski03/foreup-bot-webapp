# How to Connect Your Account to the Discord Bot

Follow these instructions to connect your ForeAdvantage account to the Discord bot. These steps are designed to be as clear as possible for users who may not be familiar with Discord.

Connecting your account to discord will allow you to be notified when tee times become available. I highly reccomend downloading the app in order to get the notification if you are away from your computer.
